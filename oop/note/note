there are two stages when using classes. the first stage is the "class definition"
the second stage is called "instantiation" make an object from class is called instantiation
Ex
"class Car(): this creating a Car class

ford = Car() this is creating instance from the class Car
"

Attributes are a variable that defined in a class. an attribute is how we store personal information about each instance.
they are a source of information for an object
Ex
" class Car():
    sound = "beep"  Attributes that all car possessed

ford = Car()
print(ford.sound)
"
#########################
SETTER AND GETTER
#########################
this are methods that we create to re-declare attributes and return attribute values
Ex:
class Car():
    brand = ' '

    def set_name(self, new_brand):     this is creating a setter function
        self.brand = new_brand
    def get_name(self):
        return self.brand               this is getter function to return the value we set


car = Car()
car.set_name('toyota')
car.get_name()
