In object-oriented programming you  write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects based on these
classes. When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have.
Making an object from a class is called instantiation, and you work with instances of a class.

Inheritance:
             You don’t always have to start from scratch when writing a class. If the class
             you’re writing is a specialized version of another class you wrote, you can
             use inheritance. When one class inherits from another, it automatically takes
             on all the attributes and methods of the first class.
